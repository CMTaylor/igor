Injecting Igor by overriding handleCommandWithRequest body requires re-implementing all of MapOperationCommand. This in turn requires including lots of uispec, frank, and json headers, even though Igor itself doesn't need those.

To inject a query engine without having to override handleCommandWithRequestBody:
- Add a public method to MapOperationCommand like selectViewsThatMatchQueryString that Igor can override.

Perhaps better:
- Find some other mechanism for injecting a query engine into the Frank server?

Fantasy future:
- Allow registering multiple query engines, and (somehow) dispatch per map request.

At the moment, sooner is more important to me than better.
